# Explaination of the Dockerfile generated by `docker init`

This Dockerfile contains multistage build with 4 steps (base, deps, build, final):

1. **base stage**: -> establish the `FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine as base` image and set up the working directory `WORKDIR /usr/src/app`

2. **deps stage**: -> run `npm ci --omit=dev` to install production deps.

3. **build stage**: -> install dev dependencies and builds the app.

4. **final stage**: -> uses minimal runtime (no dev tooling), copies `dist/output`, then serves using `npx serve`.


## For running in the production mode:

After build, using `npx serve -s dist`, the application will be available at 

- local: <http://localhost:3000>
- Network: <http://Your_personal_IP_address:3000>
